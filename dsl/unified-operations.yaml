# Prompt templates for agent invocation
prompt_templates:
  ingestion:
    template: |
      Using your {{ agent }} capabilities, extract and parse this document:
      
      Document Type: {{ document_type }}
      Format: {{ document_format }}
      
      Content:
      {{ document_content }}
      
      Requirements:
      1. Preserve all structural elements
      2. Maintain formatting where meaningful
      3. Extract metadata and properties
      4. Identify sections and hierarchy
      5. Note any parsing issues or ambiguities
      
      Return structured JSON with content, structure, and metadata.
      
  analysis:
    template: |
      As {{ agent }}, analyze this document focusing on {{ focus_area }}:
      
      Document: {{ document_id }}
      Content Preview: {{ content_preview }}
      
      Analysis Requirements:
      {{ analysis_requirements }}
      
      Provide:
      1. Key findings with evidence
      2. Issues identified with severity
      3. Recommendations for improvement
      4. Quality score (0-100)
      
  remediation:
    template: |
      Using {{ agent }} expertise, remediate these issues:
      
      Document: {{ document_id }}
      Issues: {{ issues_list }}
      Quality Target: {{ quality_threshold }}
      
      For each issue:
      1. Understand the problem
      2. Generate appropriate fix
      3. Validate fix doesn't break other parts
      4. Ensure quality improvement
      
      Return remediated content with change log.
      
  validation:
    template: |
      As {{ agent }}, validate this document:
      
      Document: {{ document_id }}
      Type: {{ document_type }}
      Requirements: {{ validation_requirements }}
      
      Check:
      {{ validation_checklist }}
      
      Return validation report with pass/fail status and score.
