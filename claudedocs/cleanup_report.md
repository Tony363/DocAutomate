## 🏗️ Structural Improvements

### File Organization Overhaul

#### Before Cleanup
```
DocAutomate/
├── test_*.py (5 files scattered in root)
├── NDA-Tony-yoobroo.pdf (docs in root)
├── test.json (temporary file)
├── [various other files]
```

#### After Cleanup
```
DocAutomate/
├── tests/
│   ├── test_claude_integration.py
│   ├── test_json_fix.py
│   ├── test_nda.py
│   ├── test_sample.py
│   └── test_timeout_fix.py
├── docs/
│   └── NDA-Tony-yoobroo.pdf
├── claudedocs/
│   └── cleanup_report.md
├── logs/ (created, ready for runtime logs)
└── [core modules properly organized]
```

#### Benefits Achieved
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## 🔧 Dead Code Elimination

### Unused Imports Removed

#### `claude_cli.py`
```python
# REMOVED (Line 15)
import shlex  # Unused - no shlex.split() or related calls found
```
**Impact**: Reduced memory footprint, cleaner imports

#### `workflow.py`  
```python
# REMOVED (Lines 18-20)
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
```
**Impact**: Eliminated unused email functionality placeholders

### Validation Results
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: No usage found in codebase
- ✅ **Import Testing**: All modules import successfully
- ✅ **Integration Testing**: Full pipeline functional
- ✅ **API Testing**: All endpoints operational

---

## 🧪 Test Infrastructure Enhancement

### Path Resolution Fixes
All test files updated with proper parent directory imports:

```python
# Added to all test files
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))
```

### Test Results After Cleanup
```
