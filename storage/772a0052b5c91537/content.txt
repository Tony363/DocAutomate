I'll help you read the contents of a file. However, you haven't specified which file you'd like me to read. Could you please provide the file path or name of the file you want me to read?

For example:
- `test_claude_integration.py`
- `claude_cli.py`
- Or any other file in your DocAutomate project

What file would you like me to read?
