I'm unable to access the file at `/tmp/tmpcczsudsv.pdf` as it requires your permission. Could you please:

1. Grant permission when prompted, or
2. Provide the PDF file in a location within the current working directory (like `/home/tony/Desktop/DocAutomate/`)

Alternatively, you can copy the PDF to the current directory and I can read it from there.
